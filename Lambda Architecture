Lambda Architecture:
                design pattern specifically crafted for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency data processing pipelines. 
                combines batch processing for comprehensive and reliable computation of historical data with real-time stream processing for immediate insights. 


Principles of the Lambda Architecture
                    Immutable Data:
                                    All data entering the system is treated as an immutable, append-only log.
                                    The raw, unaltered data is the single source of truth.
                                    Ensures reprocessability, fault tolerance, and consistency.
                    Separation of Concerns:
                                      The architecture splits data processing into two distinct layers:
                                                                          Batch Layer for high-latency, comprehensive processing.
                                                                          Speed Layer for low-latency, incremental processing.
                                     
                    Eventual Consistency:
                                          Queries on the system eventually return consistent results, blending historical (batch) data and real-time (speed) data.
                    Scalability and Fault Tolerance:
                                                    Built on distributed systems that can scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes.
                                                    Fault tolerance is achieved by redundant data storage and parallel processing.

Architecture Components in Depth
1. Data Sources
            Origin of the raw data ingested into the Lambda Architecture.
            Types of Data:
                          Streaming Data: Continuous streams like user interactions, IoT sensor data, or financial transactions.
                          Batch Data: Periodic data dumps, such as end-of-day sales reports or monthly logs.
            Data Ingestion:
                                  Parallel Ingestion: Data is routed simultaneously to the Batch Layer and the Speed Layer.
                                  Technologies: Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, or RabbitMQ.
2. Batch Layer
          Stores and processes the entire historical dataset in an immutable and comprehensive manner.
        Features:
                  Raw Data Storage: Maintains a permanent record of all incoming data.
                  Batch Views:
                  Results of batch processing.
                  Optimized and aggregated data for query execution.
        Processing Workflow:
                  Raw Data Storage:
                  Data is stored in cost-efficient, append-only storage (e.g., HDFS, Amazon S3).
                  Immutable data ensures data integrity and simplifies debugging.

        Batch Processing:
                      Periodically processes the raw data into batch views.
                      Focused on accuracy and completeness rather than speed.
                      Example: Computing daily sales totals or monthly trends.
        Output Storage:
                        Processed batch views are saved in the Serving Layer for querying.
        Technologies:
                    Storage: HDFS, S3, Google Cloud Storage.
                    Processing: Apache Hadoop (MapReduce), Apache Spark, Hive, or Presto.
3. Speed Layer
        Provides low-latency access to the most recent data by processing it in near real-time.
        Features:
                Processes unindexed, newly arriving data.
                Produces real-time views available for immediate querying.
                Handles data only temporarily; older data is discarded once batch processing catches up.
        Processing Workflow:
        Ingestion:
                    Receives streaming data directly from the source.
        Real-Time Processing:
                    Applies lightweight transformations or aggregations.
                    Maintains minimal state for quick updates.
        Output Storage:
                  Results are stored in memory or fast-access storage systems (e.g., Redis, Hazelcast).
        Technologies:
                    Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming, or Kafka Streams.
4. Serving Layer
            Hosts the results from both the batch and speed layers for querying by end users.
            Features:
                    Consolidates data from the batch layer (batch views) and speed layer (real-time views).
                      Provides APIs or query interfaces for user interaction.
            Processing Workflow:
                Indexing:
                        Batch views are indexed for efficient querying.
                        Queries are resolved by merging batch and real-time results.
                Query Execution:
                              Executes user queries and provides unified, near-real-time responses.
                Technologies:
                              Databases: Cassandra, HBase, Elasticsearch, Druid.
                Query Engines: Presto, Impala, or APIs.
5. Query Layer
            Interfaces with users or applications to fetch insights.
            Workflow:
                  Queries are sent to both the serving layer (batch views) and the speed layer (real-time views).
                    Results from both layers are merged to provide comprehensive, up-to-date responses.
            Technologies:
                    SQL-like tools, dashboards, or machine learning inference systems.

How the Lambda Architecture Works
Data Arrival:
            Data enters the pipeline from the source.
            Sent simultaneously to the Batch Layer and the Speed Layer.
Batch Processing:
          Data is stored in an append-only, immutable format.
          Processed periodically to generate batch views, which are saved in the serving layer.


Real-Time Processing:
          New data is processed immediately to create real-time views.
          Temporary results cover the gap left by the batch layerâ€™s latency.
Query Execution:
        User queries retrieve data from both batch and real-time views.
        Results are merged to present a unified response.
Handoff:
          Once batch processing completes, the speed layer discards its copy of the now-indexed data.

Benefits of Lambda Architecture
                  Comprehensive Insights:
                              Combines historical and real-time data for a complete view.
                  Low Latency:
                              Real-time insights ensure responsiveness.
                  Fault Tolerance:
                            Redundant processing layers handle failures gracefully.
                  Scalability:
                                Distributed systems support scaling with data volume.
                  Debugging and Reprocessing:
                                Immutable data allows reprocessing in case of errors.
Challenges of Lambda Architecture
          Complexity:
                  Requires maintaining two separate pipelines (batch and speed).
          Consistency:
                    Ensuring synchronized logic and results between layers can be challenging.
          Cost:
                  Running two parallel pipelines can be resource-intensive.
          Latency in Batch Layer:
                              Batch processing inherently introduces delays.
